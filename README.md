# Techgig-Machine-Learning-Solution - 2017

This machine learning challenge was held on 8th June - 9th June 2017 in
Bengaluru, India.

Out of more than 1000 participants, top 10 teams were called to the final round.
This was an offline round. The time given to solve this problem - (8th June, 1pm to 9th June, 10am)

I participated individually and secured 2nd rank. 

Problem: To predict if a financial instrument (say mutual fund) managed by a
particular advisor will get redeemed or not.

Following were the prediction accuracy achieved:
1. Mean Predictions - 70.69%
2. Single Model (XGBoost) - 67%
3. Voting Ensemble - 68.56%

Libraries and Tool used:
1. R
2. data.table, xgboost, lubridate, purrr

Key Learning: Always, always understand the problem in detail before start thinking
about the solution. 

Note: To help people learn, I want to make the data set available also. But its
size exceeds 4 GB. Will soon upload on the drive.
